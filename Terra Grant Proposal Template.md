## Project Overview

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Terra grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project. | Founded in 2018, SafePal is a cryptocurrency wallet that aims to provide a secure and user-friendly crypto management platform for the masses. Being the first hardware wallet portfolio of Binance, SafePal is now serving more than 4 million users across the globe. SafePal provides hardware wallet and software wallet product lines, all paired and managed through the SafePal App, where users can easily store, manage, swap, trade, and grow their crypto wealth. SafePal has not only supported 15 languages, 30 blockchains, 10,000+ tokens, and NFTs, but also integrated with BinanceTrading DApp, and all DApps on Ethereum, BSC, Tron, Solana networks and more.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Terra.| SafePal will fully support Terra and its ecosystem by integrating the core elements of Terra ecosystem including $Luna, stable tokens, CW20 tokens, DApps into the wallet, enabling the large and active SafePal community to access the Terra ecosystem safely and easily. 
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.| Terra has been one of the leading blockchains in the space and SafePal has always planned to support Terra in its earliest pipeline. The Terra integration is also heavily requested by the SafePal community. As a user-oriented and community-driven brand, SafePal will follow user demands and support Terra in the product. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components | Not applicable
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality | Not applicable. SafePal is close-sourced at the moment
- An overview of the technology stack to be used | Not applicable
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed | Not applicable. SafePal is close-sourced at the moment
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic | SafePal has already supported 30 blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BinanceSmartChain, Solana, Avalanche, Fantom and many more. (Full list can be found on https://safepal.io/coin/lists. 
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
    - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Terra landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? | On one hand, SafePal has a large and active global user base which can help to accelerate the adoption of Terra blockchain technology in the ecosystem. By brining Terra to the community, SafePal can become a powerful user acquisition and education platform for Terra and the applications in the Terra ecosystem. On the other hand, SafePal provides the most secure and user-friendly wallet solution for users to secure and manage their Terra assets securely and easily. These two are the great fits for the wider adoption of Terra in the long run.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? The 4 million+ user base of SafePal (and still growing exponentially)
- What need(s) does your project meet? Users need a safe and user-friendly wallet to keep their Terra assets secure and manage the assets with the least efforts. SafePal provides not only the most secure hardware wallet (www.safepal.io) for users to keep their private keys safe, but also provide a one-stop asset management tool---the SafePal App---for users to manage and growth their crypto assets day to day. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Terra ecosystem? | We don't think there are any other wallet solutions like us in Terra ecosystem or in other ecosystems, as we provide both the most secure hardware wallet solution and also the most friendly software wallet to the users, both types of wallets paired and managed through the SafePal App, where users can manage, send, swap, trade and stake as they like. 
    - If so, how is your project different?
    - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. 

| Since SafePal is close-sourced at the moment, we are not able to disclose the codes or APIs here. But we have already started to integrate Terra as we plan, including $LUNA, CW20 tokens, stable tokens and DApps into the wallet. The integration is 30% done and we are looking to deliver the new update within 4-6 weeks.

This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or RFP (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from Terra
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Terra. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Terra Website

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- We have supported a lot of early-stage projects on BinanceSmartChain and Nervos for pre-token-launch user education and acquisition through our WalletHolderOffering program. Users need to complete assigned tasks and use the product in order to win exclusive token incentives from our partners. Previous WHO campaigns have been very successful, with the track record metrics shared with Terraformlabs members already.
- We have applied for the Nervos grant, which will be disclosed by Nervos foundation on December 21, 2021.
